                What is luxury?

                To us, it's about making smarter choices and having the quiet confidence that allows you to focus as much on what you choose to leave out, as what you choose to put in.

                It's choosing to craft our vodka with whey, rather than the traditional grain or potatoes, because whey delivers a silkier, smoother taste that is more pleasurable to the mouth, with less of the burn found in other spirits.  
            </p>
            <p class="copy">
                It's choosing to distill our vodka 3 times, and filter it through a bed of carbon and pure New Zealand spring water; a process that results in less methanol than any other vodka, creating a clean spirit that lets the true flavours shine through.
            </p>
            <p class="copy">
                What's left is a smooth luxury spirit with light lemon and vanilla hints, delivering a sublime drinking experience. 
            </p>
            <p class="copy">
                Most importantly, to our drinkers, luxury isn't hype, or photo shoots on yachts. It's a real, discernible difference that starts when you pick up our understatedly stylish bottle to the point when the spirit hits the tongue.

                VDKA 6100 was co-created by Robert De Niro, American actor and business entrepreneur. A global tastemaker, Mr. De Niro was involved from the very beginning because of  his reputation as a visionary in the hospitality business and for his renowned ability for making good choices.

            <p class="copy">
                Together, we didn't just set out to create a vodka. We created VDKA 6100.
