                What is luxury?

                To us, it’s about making smarter choices. It’s about having a quiet confidence that allows you to focus as much on what you choose to leave out, as what you choose to put in.

                It’s choosing to craft our vodka with whey, rather than the traditional grain or potatoes, because whey delivers a silkier, smoother taste that is more pleasurable to the mouth, with less of the burn found in other spirits.  
            </p>
            <p class="copy">
                It’s choosing to distill our vodka 3 times, and filter it through a bed of carbon and pure New Zealand spring water; a process that results in less toxic methanol than any other vodka. 
            </p>
            <p class="copy">
                It’s choosing to leave out any extraneous elements and focus only on the best. So that’s what’s left is a smooth luxury spirit with light lemon and vanilla hints, delivering a sublime drinking experience. 
            </p>
            <p class="copy">
                Most importantly, to our drinkers, luxury isn’t hype, or photo shoots on yachts. It’s a real, discernible difference that starts when you pick up our understatedly stylish bottle to the point when the spirit hits the tongue.

                One of the first people to appreciate the unique taste and quality that goes into VDKA 6100 was Robert De Niro, American actor and business entrepreneur. As the co-creator of VDKA 6100 he is involved in launching the brand in the US and eventually worldwide. A global tastemaker, Mr. De Niro was tapped from the beginning for his reputation as a visionary in the hospitality business and for his renowned ability for making good choices.
